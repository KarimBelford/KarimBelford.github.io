<h1>Whole Roasted Cauliflower With Tahini Sauce</h1>
<img src="Call.jpg" alt="logo" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<h1> Ingredients </h1>
<p>
<p>1 whole cauliflower </p>
<p>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided </p>
<p>½ teaspoon salt
<p>1 tablespoon zaatar spice ( or try dukkah!)  ( or try a mix of coriander, cumin and optional sumac)</p>
<p>1 cup water </p>
<p>1 Batch TAHINI SAUCE ( go to recipe) </p>
<p>Garnish with fresh herbs – parsley, dill and or mint, sprinkle with optional Aleppo chilli flakes, drizzle with this optional Tahini sauce! </p>

<h1>Instructions </h1>
<p>Preheat oven to 425F.</p>

<p>Trim the cauliflower – either cutting off the stem (easier) or leaving it intact, trimming and slicing the bottom  so it stands up strait.</p>

<p>Place it in an oven proof skillet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon oil all over the cauliflower, sprinkle with salt and Zaatar spice.  Pour one cup of water into the bottom of the pan.</p>

<p>Cover tightly with foil and bake for 45-55 minutes. Smaller cauliflowers heads will take 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Very carefully take the foil off, minding the hot steam (it will burn!). Drizzle with a little more olive oil, place back in the oven for 30 minutes, perhaps rotating halfway through. At this point it should be deeply golden, but if not, continue roasting until it is, another 10-15 minutes.</p>

<p>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with fresh herbs, optional Aleppo chilli flakes,  and either drizzle the tahini sauce over the whole thing right in the pan, or cut it up, like a cake, into wedges and serve the tahini sauce on the side.</p>
