<h1>Kyoto Style Sweet Potatoes With Miso, Ginger & Scallions</h1>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<p></p>
<p>2–3 yams (or small sweet potatoes) sliced in half, lengthwise</p>
<p>olive oil for brushing</p>
<p>¼ cup olive oil, coconut oil, butter or ghee</p>
<p>1 large shallot, very finely diced ( about ½ cup)</p>
<p>2 teaspoons ginger finely minced</p>
<p>1 tablespoon miso ( I prefer white, but any color will work)</p>
<p>salt to taste</p>
<p>3 Scallions, sliced</p>
<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>Preheat oven to 425F</p>

<p>Cut sweet potatoes in half lengthwise and place on a parchment-lined sheet pan, cut side down. Brush or spray the skin sides with olive oil.</p>

<p>Roast 30-40 minutes until fork tender (check at 30 mins, keeping in mind they need may need longer if very large) When tender, flip over and broil if they need more caramelization. Adding little color ( or char) around the edges is good here.</p>

<p>While they are roasting make the Shallot Ginger Miso “butter”. Heat the oil, butter or ghee over medium low heat, add the shallot and carefully sauté until golden, stirring often about 5-6 minutes. Add the ginger, cook 2-3 more minutes. Add the miso and using a fork, mash and it into the mixture, breaking it up as much as possible. It won’t get creamy, just mash the miso as best you can with the fork into the tiniest little bits, and let these bits get slightly crispy, sautéing 2 minutes or so. Turn heat off.</p>

<p>When sweet potatoes are caramelized to your liking, place on a platter flesh side up, reheat the miso butter, pierce the flesh in a few spots using a spoon, (so miso butter can get down inside) then spoon a tablespoon or two of the sauce over each one, making sure to include the flavourful “brown bits” ( shallot, ginger, miso).</p>

<p>Sprinkle with a little finishing salt ( I really like using smoked Maldon Salt here) and sprinkle with chopped scallions.</p>
