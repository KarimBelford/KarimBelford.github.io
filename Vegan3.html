<h1>Tofu Stir-Fry With Broccolini & Mushrooms</h1>
<img src="Broc.jpg" alt="logo" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<p>8 ounces broccolini (or broccoli)</p>
<p>8–10 ounces tofu- patted dry, cubed ( or chicken or shrimp)</p>
<p>1 fat shallot- thinly sliced</p>
<p>5 garlic cloves- rough chopped</p>
<p>8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, sliced (or use button or cremini)</p>
<p>1–2 tablespoons coconut oil or peanut oil</p>
<p>Salt and Pepper</p>
<p>4–5 chilies de arbol (dried red chilies)</p>
<p>2 tablespoons sweetened black vinegar (or sub rice wine vinegar with a teaspoon honey or sugar if vegan)</p>
<p>2 tablespoons soy sauce</p>
<p>2 tablespoons water</p>

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>Place broccolini in a steamer basket, inside a medium pot with 1 inch water. Bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat down and simmer 5 minutes. Turn heat off. Uncover.</p>
<p>At the same time chop the shallots, garlic and slice the mushrooms.</p>
<p>Gather the rest of the ingredients together by the stove.</p>
<p>In a wok or cast iron skillet, heat the coconut oil over medium high heat. When hot, season the oil with a generous 5 finger pinch of salt and fresh cracked pepper.</p>
<p>Add tofu (or chicken or shrimp) and brown all sides flipping and turning until most sides sides are golden and crispy, about 5-6 minutes. If it is sticking, make sure pan is well oiled, and let it develop a little golden crust before flipping. When it gets this “crust” it will naturally release itself from the pan- if it’s sticking, you may be flipping it prematurely. Set the tofu (or chicken or shrimp) aside.</p>
<p>Add a little more coconut oil to the wok and heat. When hot, add shallot and garlic, stirring constantly until golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add sliced shiitake mushrooms. Continue cooking turning heat to medium, stirring often until tender. Add dried chilies and optional nuts. Sauté 1 minute.</p>
<p>Add vinegar, soy and water. Stir. Using tongs, add the steamed broccolini and toss to coat. Add tofu, give a few stirs, coating all. Taste for salt, add more if necessary. Divide among two bowls.</p>
<p>Garnish with Peanut Chilli Crunch,  crispy shallots, scallions or toasted sesame seeds.</p>
